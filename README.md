# A program for displaying song lyrics
![Login](./assets/login_page.PNG?raw=true)

Written using Python, deployed using Flask. Utilizes the Spotify API to fetch the song name and the Genius API to fetch the lyrics. Uses [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for the CSS.

## Getting started
1. The `requirements.txt` file should contain the names of the modules needed.
2. To run this program, you'll need a [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/) account and a [Genius](https://genius.com/) account. 
    * You'll need to register this client with each service's API. From there, you'll need to add secrets such as an API key to `secret_example.py`. 
    * Afterwards, rename `secret_example.py` to `secret.py`.
    * **This is required if you wish to host the program.** 
3. For a user, only a Spotify account is needed.

This was my first big project. First webapp and first time using APIs.
